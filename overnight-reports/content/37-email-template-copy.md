# Welcome to EUONGELION

Dear [First Name],

Thank you for joining EUONGELION. You've taken a meaningful step toward a deeper relationship with God through His Word.

**What is EUONGELION?**

This is not another devotional app. EUONGELION offers carefully crafted Scripture-based devotionals designed for genuine encounter with God, not just information about Him.

Every devotional is available in three depths:
- **1 Minute** - A verse, a word, a prayer
- **5 Minutes** - Story, Scripture, and reflection
- **15 Minutes** - Deep study with original languages

You choose your depth. Every day.

---

**Where to Begin**

We recommend starting with **"Finding Your Identity in Christ"** - a 7-day series that establishes the foundation for everything else. Before you can walk with God, you must know who you are in Him.

---

**The Soul Audit**

When you're ready, take the Soul Audit - a gentle self-assessment that helps you understand where you are in your spiritual journey. It takes about 6 minutes and provides personalized recommendations.

[Take the Soul Audit]

---

**A Word Before You Go**

This app exists because we believe spiritual formation matters more than engagement metrics. You won't find gamification or guilt trips here. Just depth, beauty, and the Word that has been transforming lives for thousands of years.

We're glad you're here.

Grace and peace,
The EUONGELION Team
