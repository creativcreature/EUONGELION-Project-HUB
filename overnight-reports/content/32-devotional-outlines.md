# EUONGELION Devotional Outlines

*10 new devotional structural outlines following the chiastic structure (A-B-C-B'-A' pattern)*

## Understanding Chiastic Structure

The chiastic structure (or chiasmus) is an ancient literary pattern where ideas mirror each other around a central pivot point. The structure A-B-C-B'-A' creates a symmetrical pattern that:

- Opens and closes with related themes (A and A')
- Has secondary themes that mirror each other (B and B')
- Emphasizes the central point (C) as the theological climax

This structure was common in Hebrew poetry and literature, making it particularly appropriate for Scripture-based devotionals.

## Implementation Notes

### For Each Devotional

3. **15-Minute Immersion:** Full development of all five sections with deep dives

### Key Principles

- The C section is always the theological heart; it should be the most memorable
- A and A' should bookend with clear resonance
- B and B' should mirror as problem/solution or question/answer
- Include original language work primarily in the 15-minute version
- Every outline should have practical application and reflection questions
