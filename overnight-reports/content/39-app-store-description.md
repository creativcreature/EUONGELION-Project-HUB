### Full Description

**EUONGELION is not another devotional app.**

This is a space for genuine encounter with God through Scripture. No gamification. No guilt trips. No shallow content. Just depth, beauty, and the Word that has been transforming lives for thousands of years.

---

**WHY EUONGELION?**

Most devotional apps treat spiritual growth like a video game, complete with streaks, badges, and leaderboards. We believe your relationship with God deserves better.

EUONGELION (from the Greek word for "good news") brings together ancient wisdom and modern design. Every devotional is carefully crafted to help you encounter God, not just gather information about Him.

---

**THREE DEPTHS OF ENGAGEMENT**

Choose how deep you want to go each day:

- **1 MINUTE** - A verse, a reflection word, and a prayer. Perfect for busy moments when you still want to connect.

- **5 MINUTES** - Story-driven devotional with Scripture and reflection questions. The core daily experience.

- **15 MINUTES** - Deep study including original Hebrew and Greek, historical context, and theological reflection. For those hungry for more.

Same content, different depths. You decide what fits your day.

---

**SOUL AUDIT**

Understand where you are in your spiritual journey with our thoughtful self-assessment tool. The Soul Audit explores eight areas of spiritual life and provides personalized series recommendations.

This isn't a test to pass. It's a mirror to help you see clearly and grow intentionally.

---

**CURATED SERIES**

Devotionals are organized into thematic series that take you on a journey:

- Foundations of Faith - Essential Christian doctrine for new believers

- And many more covering Scripture study, spiritual disciplines, and practical faith
