## Launch Announcement Posts (10 Variations)

### Post 1: The Problem Statement

**Caption:**
Most devotional apps treat your spiritual life like a video game.

Streaks. Badges. Leaderboards.

As if encountering God were a competition.

We built something different.

EUONGELION is a devotional app designed for depth, not distraction. No gamification. No guilt trips. Just Scripture, reflection, and prayer.

Ancient wisdom. Modern design.

### Post 4: The Mission

**Caption:**
"The lost are waiting."

That's our mission.

EUONGELION exists because we believe technology should serve spiritual formation, not exploit attention.

We built a devotional app with depth because surface-level Christianity isn't working.

The Church needs tools that form souls, not just fill time.

We're just getting started.

### Post 5: Design Focus

**Caption:**
We believe Scripture is beautiful and deserves beautiful presentation.

EUONGELION was designed with sacred minimalism in mind. Dark mode first. Typography forward. Focused. Calm.

Because your time with God shouldn't feel like checking social media.

Now available. Link in bio.

### Post 6: Greek Word Origin

**Caption:**
EUONGELION (Greek: euangelion)

Literally: "good news"

The word from which we get "gospel" and "evangelism."

We chose this name because that's what we're about: the good news that changes everything.

A devotional app rooted in the eternal Word.

Now available. Link in bio.

### Post 7: Not Another App

**Caption:**
We didn't want to build another devotional app.

The world has enough apps fighting for your attention with streaks and badges.

We wanted to build something that helps you encounter God. That's it.

EUONGELION is the result.

Scripture. Depth. Beauty.
No distractions. No guilt.

Available now. Link in bio.
