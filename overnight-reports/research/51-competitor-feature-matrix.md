## Competitive Gaps & EUONGELION Opportunities

### 1. **Depth Without Complexity**
Most apps are either simple/shallow (First 5) or comprehensive/overwhelming (YouVersion). EUONGELION can offer curated depth.

### 2. **Formation Over Metrics**
YouVersion's streaks and badges gamify Scripture. EUONGELION's "spiritual formation, not engagement metrics" philosophy fills a gap.

### 3. **Protestant Contemplative**
Hallow owns Catholic contemplative. Lectio 365 is niche. A Protestant/evangelical-friendly contemplative option is underserved.

### 4. **Accessible Premium**
The $70-90/year premium tier prices out many believers. A donation-supported or lower-cost quality option has room.

### 5. **PWA Advantage**
Only YouVersion and Hallow have web apps. A well-executed PWA could reach users who don't want another app download.

### 6. **Shepherd Tools**
No competitor specifically serves pastors/small group leaders with ministry materials - EUONGELION's planned "Shepherd" features could differentiate.
