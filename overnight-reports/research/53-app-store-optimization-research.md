# App Store Optimization (ASO) Research for Religious/Devotional Apps

**Research Date:** January 19, 2026
**Purpose:** Research ASO best practices for EUONGELION to maximize discoverability in app stores

---

## Executive Summary

App Store Optimization (ASO) is critical for app discoverability, with approximately 70% of app installs originating from app store searches. For religious/devotional apps, success requires balancing faith-based keywords with broader wellness terms. This document covers keyword strategies, screenshot best practices, and description optimization specifically tailored for EUONGELION.

**Note:** As a PWA, EUONGELION may not initially appear in app stores. However, these principles apply if the app is wrapped with Capacitor for store distribution, and many concepts translate to web SEO as well.

## Keyword Strategy for Devotional Apps

### Primary Keywords (High Value)

Based on research into successful religious apps:

| Keyword | Search Volume | Competition | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| bible | Very High | Very High | Dominated by YouVersion |
| devotional | High | Medium | Core category |
| prayer | High | Medium-High | Hallow, others compete |
| daily devotional | Medium | Medium | Intent-rich |
| christian meditation | Medium | Medium | Growing category |
| scripture | Medium | Medium | Specific audience |
| bible study | High | High | Study-focused users |
| spiritual growth | Low-Medium | Low | Niche but targeted |

### Long-Tail Keywords (Lower Competition)

2025 trend: Long-tail queries bring more targeted traffic with less competition.

**Recommended Long-Tail Keywords:**
- "daily bible reading app"
- "christian morning devotional"
- "scripture meditation app"
- "spiritual growth tracker"
- "bible reflection app"
- "christian quiet time"
- "daily scripture reading"

### Competitor Keyword Insights

**Bible Chat Success Story:**
- Spending on nearly 2,000 keywords in the US App Store
- More than double the competition's keyword investment
- Combines ASO with SEO to capture Google traffic

### Keywords to Avoid
- Trademarked terms (YouVersion, Hallow, etc.)
- Overly generic terms (app, free, best)
- Keyword stuffing - algorithms penalize this

8. Latin America (Spanish)

### Localization Checklist

## Ratings & Reviews Strategy

### Why Reviews Matter
- Directly impact visibility and conversion

- Algorithms factor in review velocity and quality

### Best Practices
1. **Ask at the right moment** - After positive experience, not immediately
2. **Make it easy** - In-app review prompts (iOS SKStoreReviewController)
3. **Respond to reviews** - Shows engagement, especially negative ones
4. **Don't incentivize** - Against store policies

### When to Prompt for Review
- After completing first devotional
- After 3 consecutive days of use
- After bookmarking content
- NOT during first session or immediately after install

---

## PWA-Specific Considerations

Since EUONGELION is a PWA:

### Web SEO (Complement to ASO)
- Optimize landing page for "christian devotional app" etc.
- Blog content targeting long-tail keywords
- Bible Chat example: Uses SEO to drive traffic to app

### PWA Install Prompt Optimization
- Clear value proposition on install banner
- Show benefits of installation (offline, home screen)
- Time prompt after user engagement

### If Wrapping with Capacitor for Stores
- All ASO principles apply
- Can access broader audience
- Adds store review requirement (1-2 week delay on iOS)
