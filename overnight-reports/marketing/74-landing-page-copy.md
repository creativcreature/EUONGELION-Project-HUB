## The Problem Section

### Header
**Most devotional apps miss the point.**

### Body
Streaks. Badges. Notifications competing for your attention. Somewhere along the way, digital devotion became another task to check off, another metric to optimize.

But faith was never meant to be gamified.

You don't need an app that rewards you for showing up. You need a sanctuary that invites you to stay.

## The Solution Section

### Header
**EUONGELION: A Different Approach**

### Body
We built EUONGELION for believers who want more than surface-level engagement with Scripture. This is a space where ancient wisdom breathes through modern design - where every element serves your encounter with God, and nothing gets in the way.

No points. No pressure. Just presence.

## Features Section

### Section Header
**Designed for Spiritual Formation**

---

#### Feature 1: Daily Devotionals
**Scripture That Speaks to Today**

Each devotional is crafted to move from ancient text to present truth. Read Scripture in context. Sit with reflection prompts that invite genuine encounter. Let the Word work in you at its own pace.

---

#### Feature 2: Thematic Series
**Journeys with Purpose**

Not random readings, but intentional paths. Walk through Scripture by theme - identity, calling, suffering, hope. Each series builds understanding over time, leading you deeper into the heart of faith.

---

#### Feature 3: Soul Audit
**Know Where You Are**

Before you can grow, you need to see clearly. The Soul Audit helps you honestly assess where you stand spiritually - not to shame, but to illuminate. Identify areas ready for attention and receive guidance for the journey ahead.

Install EUONGELION on your device. Access your devotionals anywhere - in the mountains, on the subway, in the quiet of early morning. Your spiritual practice shouldn't depend on signal strength.

#### Feature 5: Reading Progress
**See Your Path**

Track what you've read without pressure to perform. No streaks to maintain or break. Simply a clear view of where you've been and what awaits.

---

#### Feature 6: Bookmarks
