# EUONGELION Referral Program Outline

*A referral program that matches our voice: generous, community-minded, not salesy.*

---

## Philosophy

Before designing mechanics, we need to establish principles. EUONGELION is not a typical app, and our referral program shouldn't feel like one.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Sharing should feel like generosity, not marketing.** When someone shares EUONGELION, they're offering something they believe will help - not extracting value from a friend.

2. **Rewards should enhance the spiritual experience.** No gift cards, cash, or things unrelated to the app. Rewards should give users more of what makes EUONGELION valuable.

3. **The language matters.** We don't "recruit" users or build a "sales force." We invite friends into a community. The copy must reflect our sacred, calm voice.

4. **Simplicity over cleverness.** Referral programs often get complex with tiers, leaderboards, and bonuses. We'll keep it simple and genuine.

5. **It must feel optional.** Aggressive referral prompts damage trust. We offer the opportunity to share without pressure.

## Program Structure

### Overview

**Name:** "Share the Good News" (working title - plays on EUONGELION meaning)

**Mechanic:**
- Existing user shares a unique link
- New user signs up through that link
- Both receive a benefit

**Rewards:**
- **Inviter receives:** Unlocked premium content or feature
- **Invitee receives:** The same benefit (so sharing feels generous, not extractive)

---

## User Journey

### For the Inviter (Existing User)

**Discovery Points:**
1. Dedicated "Invite Friends" section in settings/profile
2. Occasional gentle prompt after completing a series or devotional
3. Share button on individual devotionals ("Share this with a friend")
4. Email from EUONGELION after sustained usage

**Sharing Flow:**
1. User taps "Invite Friends"
2. Sees brief explanation of what happens when they share
3. Gets unique referral link
4. Shares via: text message, email, or social media
5. Can track how many friends have joined (simple count, no leaderboard)

**After Friend Joins:**
1. Receives notification: "[Friend's name] has joined EUONGELION"
2. Both accounts receive the reward
3. Simple thank you message

---

### For the Invitee (New User)

**Experience:**
1. Receives message/link from friend
2. Clicks link, lands on personalized welcome page
3. Page says: "[Friend's name] thought you might appreciate EUONGELION"
4. Clear path to start exploring (no account required initially)
5. When they create an account, both receive reward

**First Experience:**
- Welcome flow mentions they were invited
- Possibly suggests starting where their friend is (same series)
- Receives the same reward their friend gets

---

## Rewards Structure

### What to Offer

Given that EUONGELION is free, rewards should feel valuable without creating a paid tier that excludes others from core content.

**Option A: Early Access**
- Inviter and invitee get early access to new series before public release
- Creates value without paywalling existing content
- Builds community of engaged users who shape new content

**Option B: Exclusive Content**
- Special devotional series only available through referrals
- Topic: "Walking Together" - a series on Christian community
- Thematic fit: content about community, unlocked by building community

**Option C: Enhanced Features**
- Extended bookmarking (custom tags, notes)
- Personal reading statistics (if we build them)
- Custom themes or additional dark mode variations

**Option D: Donation Match**
- For every referral, we donate to a partner ministry
- Appeals to users motivated by generosity
- "You shared EUONGELION, so we donated $1 to [ministry]"

**Recommended Approach:** Start with Option A (early access) + Option D (donation match). Both feel generous rather than transactional.

## Tracking System

### Technical Requirements

**Referral Links:**
- Unique link per user: `euongelion.app/invite/[unique-code]`
- Code tied to inviter's account
- Tracks clicks and conversions

**Data to Capture:**
- Who shared (inviter user ID)
- When link was created
- Clicks on link
- Conversions (account created through link)
- Reward delivery status

**Attribution Window:**
- Link click to account creation: 30 days
- If user creates account without clicking link but later connects, don't retroactively credit
- Keep it simple and honest

**User Dashboard:**
- Simple count: "You've invited X friends"
- List of friends who've joined (if they've agreed to be visible)
- Rewards earned/available
- NO leaderboards or comparisons to other users

### Email Prompt (Sent to Engaged Users)

**Subject:** Know someone who might benefit?

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

You've been spending time in EUONGELION - thank you for making it part of your rhythm with Scripture.

We have a simple question: is there someone in your life who might benefit from what you've found here?

Maybe a friend who's been wanting to get into Scripture but hasn't found the right tool. A family member exploring faith. A small group member who mentioned wanting to be more consistent.

If so, here's your personal invitation link:

[Link]

When they join, you'll both receive [reward]. But honestly, the real gift is knowing you've pointed someone toward meaningful time with God.

No pressure if this isn't the right time. We won't ask again for a while.

Grace and peace,
The EUONGELION Team

### Share Prompt (After Completing a Series)

**Prompt:**
You've completed [Series Name].

Did this series speak to you? If so, perhaps it would speak to someone you know too.

## Success Metrics

### What We Track
- Number of users who share their link
- Click-through rate on referral links
- Conversion rate (clicks to accounts)
- Retention rate of referred users vs. organic
- Engagement level of referred users

### What We Don't Optimize For
- Raw referral numbers
- Viral coefficient
- "Whales" (users who refer many)

### What Success Looks Like
- Users share because they want to, not because we nag
- Referred users engage meaningfully (not just sign up)
- The referral experience feels consistent with EUONGELION's values
- Users report positive feelings about sharing, not awkwardness

---

## Launch Approach

### Phase 1: Soft Launch
- Enable referrals for existing engaged users only
- Simple reward (early access to one series)
- Monitor sentiment and behavior
- Iterate on messaging

### Phase 2: Broader Rollout
- Open to all users
- Add donation matching component
- Create shareable content (graphics, videos)
- Enable in-app sharing after devotionals

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Based on data, refine reward structure
- Test different messages and prompts
- Build out tracking dashboard
- Consider church/group referral variant

---

## Church and Group Variant

A separate track for ministry leaders:

**For Pastors/Leaders:**
- Unique church invite link
- Track how many congregation members join
- Access to group study guides
- Ability to recommend series to their community

**Messaging:**
"Bring EUONGELION to your congregation. Share your church's invite link and help your people find sacred space in Scripture."

This isn't about referral rewards - it's about serving ministry leaders who want to recommend a tool to their flock.

---

## Summary

The EUONGELION referral program should feel like sharing a book that changed your life with a friend who needs it - not like building a downline or earning points.

When we get it right, users share because EUONGELION has genuinely helped them, and they want that for others. The rewards are nice, but secondary to the invitation itself.

This is how we grow: person by person, relationship by relationship, as the good news of meaningful Scripture engagement spreads through authentic recommendation.
