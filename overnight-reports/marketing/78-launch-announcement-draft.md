### Email Body

Dear friends,

Today, we're sharing something we've been building with care and prayer: **EUONGELION** is now available.

EUONGELION (Greek for "good news") is a devotional app built on a simple conviction: your time with Scripture shouldn't feel like another app competing for your attention. It should feel like sacred space.

**What makes it different:**

- **Daily devotionals** that go deep, not just wide - Scripture in context, reflection prompts that invite genuine encounter
- **Thematic series** that trace major themes across the whole Bible
- **The Soul Audit** - honest self-assessment to illuminate where you're growing and where you need attention
- **Offline access** - install it on your device and use it anywhere
- **Sacred minimalism** - dark mode, beautiful typography, nothing competing for your attention

There are no streaks to maintain. No badges to earn. No notifications guilting you back. Just a space designed for you to meet God in Scripture.

**Our hope** is simple: that EUONGELION helps you build (or rebuild) a sustainable devotional practice. Not one measured by consecutive days, but by genuine transformation over time.

We're just getting started. This is a first version, and it will grow based on what you need. Your feedback, your prayers, and your willingness to share it with others who might benefit - all of that shapes what comes next.

Thank you for being part of this from the beginning.

Grace and peace,
[Founder Name]

P.S. - Know someone who's been looking for something like this? We'd be honored if you'd share EUONGELION with them.

Personal, story-driven, ending with invitation. Not promotional hype.

**Tweet 1:**
Today I'm releasing something I've been working on for a while: EUONGELION, a devotional app.

But first, let me tell you why.

**Tweet 2:**
I love Scripture. But I grew frustrated with every devotional app I tried.

Streaks that turned devotion into obligation. Badges that gamified my faith. Notifications that made quiet time feel like another inbox.

**Tweet 3:**
So I built something different.

EUONGELION (Greek for "good news") is designed for depth, not engagement metrics. Sacred minimalism. Scripture in context. Space to actually encounter God.

**Tweet 4:**
What's inside:

- Daily devotionals with real reflection prompts
- Thematic series tracing major themes across Scripture
- Soul Audit for honest spiritual self-assessment
- Offline access (it's a PWA)
- Dark mode, beautiful typography, nothing fighting for your attention

**Tweet 5:**
What's NOT inside:

- Streaks
- Badges
- Guilt-trip notifications
- Gamification of any kind

Your devotional life is between you and God. The app should support that, not hijack it.

**Tweet 6:**
This is version 1.0. It's not perfect. But it's ready.

I'm releasing it now because the lost are waiting - and so are believers who need a better way to spend time in the Word.

**Tweet 7:**
If you've been looking for a devotional app that treats your faith with the seriousness it deserves, I'd be honored if you'd try EUONGELION.

It's free. It works offline. No account needed to explore.

**Tweet 8:**
And if it serves you well, please share it with someone who might need it too.

Ancient wisdom meets modern design. That's the idea.

Thank you for giving it a chance.

I'm excited to share something I've been working on:

**EUONGELION** - a devotional app built for depth, not distraction.

The name comes from the Greek word for "good news" (you might recognize it from words like "evangelism"). And that's what this is about: helping people encounter the good news of Scripture in a space designed for genuine encounter.

Here's the story behind it:

I kept trying devotional apps and feeling... disappointed. They all seemed designed to maximize my engagement rather than my formation. Streaks that turned devotion into obligation. Badges that gamified my relationship with God. Constant notifications that made quiet time feel like another thing demanding my attention.

So I built something different.

**EUONGELION offers:**
- Daily devotionals with Scripture in context and real reflection prompts
- Thematic series that trace major themes across the entire Bible
- The Soul Audit - a thoughtful self-assessment to see where you're growing
- Offline access - install it on your phone and use it anywhere
- Beautiful design with dark mode and clean typography
- And crucially: NO gamification. No streaks, no badges, no guilt.

It's free. You don't even need an account to start exploring.

I'm sharing this because I believe there are others who've felt the same frustration - who want to spend time in Scripture but haven't found a digital tool that serves that desire well.

If that's you, I'd be honored if you'd try EUONGELION. And if it serves you, please share it with others who might benefit.

The lost are waiting. And so are believers who need a better way to meet God in the Word.

### Approach
Professional but personal, emphasizing the problem/solution and the thoughtful approach

---

Today I'm launching **EUONGELION**, a devotional app I've been building.

I want to share the thinking behind it, because it reflects a conviction I have about product design:

**The best products serve users, not exploit them.**

Most devotional apps have adopted the engagement playbook from social media: streaks, badges, notifications, gamification. These tactics work - they drive daily active users and retention metrics.

But they also corrupt the purpose.

When you gamify devotion, you turn spiritual practice into obligation. Miss a day and your streak resets. The app becomes another source of guilt, another voice demanding your attention.

EUONGELION takes a different approach: **sacred minimalism**.

- Design that focuses attention rather than fragmenting it
- Features that serve formation over engagement
- No streaks, badges, or guilt-driven notifications
- Respect for the user's autonomy and relationship with God

The result is something quieter. An app that trusts you to show up without manipulation. Scripture presented beautifully. Reflection prompts that invite genuine engagement. A Soul Audit for honest self-assessment.

I don't know if this approach will "succeed" by typical startup metrics. But I believe it's the right way to build a spiritual tool.

EUONGELION is free and available now. If you're interested in products that prioritize user wellbeing - or if you've been looking for a devotional app that doesn't feel exploitative - I'd welcome your feedback.

## Press Release Format

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**EUONGELION Launches: A Devotional App Designed for Depth, Not Distraction**

*New faith app rejects gamification in favor of "sacred minimalism"*

[CITY, STATE] - [DATE] - EUONGELION, a new devotional Progressive Web App, launched today with a different approach to digital faith tools: no streaks, no badges, no gamification.

"Most devotional apps have adopted engagement tactics from social media," said [Founder Name], creator of EUONGELION. "We wanted to build something that serves spiritual formation instead of exploiting it."

EUONGELION (Greek for "good news") offers daily Scripture-based devotionals, thematic series tracing major biblical themes, and a Soul Audit for spiritual self-assessment.

EUONGELION is free and available now at [website]. As a Progressive Web App, it can be installed on any device and works offline.
