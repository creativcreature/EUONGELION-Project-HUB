### Template 1: General Request (Close Relationship)

**Subject:** A Quick Favor - Would You Share Your Experience with EUONGELION?

---

Hi [Name],

I hope this finds you well.

You've been using EUONGELION for a while now, and I'd love to hear how it's been for you. As we prepare to share the app more widely, testimonials from people who've actually used it mean everything.

If you have a few minutes, would you share a brief thought about your experience? It doesn't need to be polished - just honest.

Here are some prompts if helpful:
- What drew you to EUONGELION initially?
- How has it fit into your daily or weekly rhythm?
- Is there a particular feature or devotional that stood out?
- What would you tell a friend about it?

Even 2-3 sentences would be wonderful. And if now isn't a good time, no pressure at all.

Thank you for being an early user and for any thoughts you're willing to share.

With gratitude,
[Your Name]

### Template 2: General Request (Professional/Acquaintance)

**Subject:** Request for EUONGELION Testimonial

---

Dear [Name],

Thank you for being among the early users of EUONGELION. Your willingness to try the app while it's still growing has been invaluable.

As we prepare to share EUONGELION more broadly, we're gathering testimonials from users who can speak to their genuine experience. Would you be willing to share a brief reflection?

A helpful testimonial typically includes:
- Your background (role, denomination, or how you'd describe yourself spiritually)
- What problem or need EUONGELION addresses for you
- A specific aspect of the app that's been meaningful
- Who you'd recommend it to

Length is up to you - anything from a few sentences to a short paragraph is perfect.

If you're comfortable, we'd include your first name and a general descriptor (e.g., "Sarah, small group leader in Atlanta"). We're happy to keep you anonymous if preferred.

Please let me know if you have any questions. And if this isn't the right time, no worries at all.

Thank you for considering this request.

Warmly,
[Your Name]

### Template 3: Feature-Specific Request (Soul Audit)

**Subject:** Your Experience with the Soul Audit

---

Hi [Name],

I remember you mentioned finding the Soul Audit helpful. Would you be willing to share a sentence or two about that experience?

Specifically, I'd love to know:
- What was it like going through the assessment?
- Did anything surprise you about the results?
- Has it shaped how you're approaching your spiritual growth?

Your words could help others understand what the Soul Audit offers - not as a marketing pitch, but as genuine experience.

No pressure if this doesn't feel right, and happy to keep it anonymous if you prefer.

Thanks for considering,
[Your Name]

---

### Template 4: Feature-Specific Request (Design/Experience)

**Subject:** Quick Question About Your EUONGELION Experience

---

Hi [Name],

You once mentioned appreciating how EUONGELION feels to use - the design, the simplicity, something along those lines. Would you be willing to put that into a sentence or two?

We believe design matters for devotional practice, and hearing from users who've noticed the difference would help others understand what we're trying to create.

Even something brief like "I like using EUONGELION because..." would be valuable.

Thank you for considering,
[Your Name]

### Template 5: Follow-Up Request (After Positive Comment)

**Subject:** Could I Share What You Said?

---

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your kind words about EUONGELION the other day. What you shared really encouraged me.

Would you be willing to let us use your words as a testimonial? I can quote you directly or paraphrase with your approval. We can use your full name, first name only, or keep it anonymous - whatever you're comfortable with.

Here's roughly what I'd love to share:
"[Their original quote or paraphrase]"

Let me know if that works, or if you'd like to adjust the wording.

Thanks again for your encouragement,
[Your Name]

## Response Framework

### What Makes a Great Testimonial

When users ask what to write, share this guidance:

**The best testimonials are:**
- Specific rather than generic ("The Soul Audit helped me identify my prayer life needed attention" vs. "It's really helpful")
- Personal ("As a busy mom of three..." or "Coming back to faith after years away...")
- Honest (including initial hesitations that were overcome)
- Focused on transformation or benefit
- Brief (2-4 sentences is perfect)

**Helpful elements to include:**
- Who you are (role, life stage, or spiritual background)
- What need EUONGELION met
- A specific feature or moment that stood out
- Who else might benefit

**Example formats:**
> "As a [role/description], I [situation/need]. EUONGELION [how it helped]. I'd recommend it to [who]."

> "I was skeptical about [concern], but [what changed]. Now [how you use it/benefit]."

> "What I love about EUONGELION is [specific thing]. It's helped me [transformation/benefit]."
